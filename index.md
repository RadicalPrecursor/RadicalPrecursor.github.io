### Here's what I've been working on lately:

[How to make the tiniest HTTP server using Node.js](/node_http_server), a fun exercise I did as I was learning how different pieces fit together in web development.

[Some notes and Js calculators](/TTEM_math_helper), a work in progress to accompany the reading of *Theory and Technique of Electronic Music* by Miller Puckette.


#### And here are some older projects:

[Analysis of Weather Data](/The_Pile/weather), where I cut my teeth on using Python for data analysis and visualization.

[My 'recipe blog'](https://mopwatercake.fail), where I have made a mess trying my hand at some more complicated web development.  Also there are cute plant pictures.  Also I have yet to actually put any recipes up.
